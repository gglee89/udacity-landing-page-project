## About the Project

This project is the second assessment project from the Udacity's FEND Nanodegree program.
My role for this course, besides going through the lessons and projects, were to evaluate for major BUGs and potential inconsistencies found along the development of the course.

## Instructions

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

All essential features described in the 'Development Strategy' section of the Project's guidelines are included in this project.
To further enhance the page usability, as suggested, the following features have been also included:
[X] Add an active state to your navigation items when a section is in the viewport.
[x] Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling (it should still be present on page load)
[x] Add a scroll to top button on the page thatâ€™s only visible when the user scrolls below the fold of the page.
[] Update/change the design/content.
[] Make sections collapsible.
